You can use [pd.read_excel()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/generated/pandas.read_excel.html) to read the file and to select specific sheets. Plot a histogram of the population counts and explain your observations. Do not use a log-scale plot for now. What does this histogram tell you about urban and rural communes in Switzerland? Are there any clear outliers on either side, and if so, which communes?\n",

    "__C)__ The figure below represents 4 types of histogram. At this stage, our distribution should look like Fig.(a). A common way to represent [power-laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law) is to use a histogram using a log-log scale  -- remember: the x-axis of an histogram is segmented in bins of equal sizes and y-values are the average of each bin. As shown in Fig.(b), small bins sizes might introduce artifacts. Fig.(b) and Fig.(c) are examples of histograms with two different bin sizes. Another great way to visualize such distribution is to use a cumulative representation, as show in Fig.(d), in which the y-axis represents the number of data points with values greater than y.  \n",

    "Create the figures (b) and (d) using the data extracted for task 1B. For Fig.(b), represent two histograms using two different bin sizes and provide a brief description of the results.
